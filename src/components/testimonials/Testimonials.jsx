He was an advanced level student and love programming language a lot. I really admired him for the active role both in studies and other department activities. He had a goal and he didnâ€™t lose sight of it, not even once. He is just one of the many people who really put their mind to something and make it happen. He was always focused and ready to make his dream come true. Hopefully he will also serve inspiration for those upcoming generation."'
